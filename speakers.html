                    <p>Coda Hale is a software engineer and cyclist from San Francisco, California, and works for Yammer, an enterprise social network, as their infrastructure architect.  He is into building small, fast services running on the JVM, designing horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, harvest-adjustable data stores, being bloody-minded about performance and security, taking advantage of all HTTP has to offer, and a bit of light cryptography.</p>

                    Craig is the founding CTO of Quirk, one of Africa's largest digital agencies. A programmer since before he can properly remember, Craig believes strongly in using technology to educate, create jobs and improve lives. As such, he's created and supported numerous pieces of widely used web-related software over the years, from the online reputation management tool BrandsEye to the open source Firefox extension SearchStatus.

                    <p>
                    Zach works at GitHub. When he's not doing that, he's blogging, hacking on open source, and filming screencasts that are anything but "traditional" screencasts. He attracted national media fame and glory when he built Facelette, a ridiculous three-hour experiment, and lost all of it again after admitting he sometimes stays home on Friday nights and replies to support emails.

                    Growing up in the Middle East left an indelible impression on Simon and sparked a passionate interest in community development, entrepreneurship and technology. After completing a B.Eng in Media Technology in the Netherlands Simon worked for several prominent digital agencies before being appointed CTO of a promising internet startup in Amsterdam. In 2009 Simon moved to South Africa to focus on community development work through the use of technology to improve lives of the less privileged.

                    2go has developed a hugely successful mobile social network around its 2go Messenger; a network that has grown to 15 million users across Africa in just a few years. If rapid infrastructure scaling doesn't present enough challenges, doing so in an emerging market only makes it more interesting. 2go will share techniques used and lessons learnt during its growth so far and what it has planned for the future.
