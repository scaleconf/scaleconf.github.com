                    <p>Coda Hale is a software engineer and cyclist from San Francisco, California, and works for Yammer, an enterprise social network, as their infrastructure architect.  He is into building small, fast services running on the JVM, designing horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, harvest-adjustable data stores, being bloody-minded about performance and security, taking advantage of all HTTP has to offer, and a bit of light cryptography.</p>

                    Zach works at GitHub. When he's not doing that, he's blogging, hacking on open source, and filming screencasts that are anything but "traditional" screencasts. He attracted national media fame and glory when he built Facelette, a ridiculous three-hour experiment, and lost all of it again after admitting he sometimes stays home on Friday nights and replies to support emails.
