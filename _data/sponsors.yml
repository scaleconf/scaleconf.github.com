      <b>Who are we?</b>
      </p> <p>
      We are first and foremost a financial service company, but we also see
      ourselves as leading technologists.
      </p> <p>
      <b>What do we do?</b>
      </p> <p>
      We build software solutions that make our clients’ and our own lives easier.
      </p> <p>
      <b>What tech do we use?</b>
      </p> <p>
      Our environment contains a diverse range of technologies. The backend language
      of choice at the moment is Scala and we are evaluating our front-end stack.
      We are redoing our architecture and aiming to build Microservices hosted on
      containers and exposing REST-like APIs.
      We have traditionally been a .NET development shop however we have decided to
      adopt a more open stack.
      We generally look for full-stack developers who are tech agnostic and would
      prefer to use the right tool for the job.
      We use Agile best practices and frameworks such as Scrum, TDD, Continuous
      Integration etc.

      Tech Startups - Avoid Sleepless Nights with Microsoft BizSpark
      </b>
      <p>
      At Microsoft we're big on business and being proudly South African. For decades
      we've focused on becoming a strategic partner to the growth of this country by
      championing sustainable development through technology. In the early days our
      goal was to put a computer on every desk. Today we aim to change the lives of
      millions by developing products and solutions that people love and businesses
      need.
      </p>
      <p>
      We firmly believe that access to education and opportunity is the foundation
      upon which great nations are built. That's why we have invested in South Africa
      by continually supporting its rapidly emerging SME sector. Individuals who are
      brave enough to nurture their own creative ideas into platforms for job creation
      and economic growth should be celebrated. They are the engines that keep our
      country's economy ticking.
      </p>
      <p>
      With this in mind, we'd like to introduce Microsoft BizSpark.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is important to recognise the role technology startups play as significant
      contributors to the small enterprise mix. In just a few years businesses of this
      nature have revolutionised the way the world works by introducing services and
      platforms that simply did not exist before.
      </p>
      <p>
      To help drive this message forward Microsoft South Africa has initiated the
      BizSpark programme, a supportive forum that aims to drive the founding and
      growth of up to 600 technology start ups over the next three years.
      </p>
      <p>
      With assistance from the Jobs Fund we are partnering with South Africa's most
      inspiring technology SMEs to help facilitate their growth and development. It's
      a 360° view that centres on you, the startup. BizSpark provides technology,
      support and a community that is focused on how you work, how you view the world
      and how you are getting out there to change it.
      </p>
      <p>
      BizSpark offers a comprehensive array of the latest products that are aimed at facilitating growth. Participation gives members the equivalent of an MSDN subscription at no cost. This includes get access to over 900 products such as Windows Azure, Visual Studio, Windows Server and Windows 8. Everything you need to succeed, without the price tag.
      The tools are just one aspect of the BizSpark approach. Members are also afforded access to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform - eradicating the restrictive costs often associated with hosting servers and purchasing storage capacity as a small business.
      It's a package designed with technology start-ups in mind. Licensing and hosting fees can be difficult to honour when you're starting out. Microsoft would like to give you the tools needed to build a business without the sleepless nights.
      Application to the Microsoft BizSpark programme is open to anyone, provided your business complies with certain expectations:
      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be actively engaged in development of a software- based product or service at the core of your current(or intended) business.  </li>
        <li>The software must add significant and primary functionality to the integrated Microsoft software. You need to own the software you're developing, i.e. you cannot be licensing it.  </li>
        <li>Your business must be privately held and have been in business for less than five years.  </li>
        <li>You need to be bringing in less than R5 million in annual revenue. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
