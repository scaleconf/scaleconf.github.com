      <p>
      We are first and foremost a financial service company, but we also see ourselves
      as leading technologists.

      <p>
      <b>What do we do?</b>

      <p>
      <b>What tech do we use?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
      Our environment contains a diverse range of technologies. Our backends consists
      of APIs written in Scala and Golang with our frontends developed in React. We make
      use of a Microservices architecture that can enable continuous deployment through
      the likes of Gitlab, Docker and Kubernetes. It is less about the tools and rather
      the people who help craft and develop these infrastructures of tomorrow, so we
      generally look for Full Stack developers and testers that are tech agnostic and
      can utilise the right tool for the job.
