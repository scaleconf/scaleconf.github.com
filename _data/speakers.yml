      How to Properly Blame Things for Causing Latency: An Introduction to
      Distributed Tracing and Zipkin
    abstract: >
      Latency analysis is the act of blaming components for causing user
      perceptible delay. In today's world of microservices, this can be
      tricky as requests can fan out across polyglot components and even
      data-centers. In many cases, the root source of latency isn't a
      component, but rather a link between components.
      </p><p>
      This session will overview how to debug latency problems, using call
      graphs created by Zipkin.  While we're at it, we'll discuss how the
      model works, and how to safely trace production. We'll demo with an
      example app you can download, using spring boot with spring cloud
      sleuth. Finally, we'll overview the ecosystem, including tools to
      trace other languages and frameworks.
      </p><p>
      When you leave, you'll at least know something about distributed
      tracing, and hopefully be on your way to blaming things for causing
      latency!

      Networking for the next billion
    abstract: >
      Facebook’s user-base is quickly approaching the total number of users
      connected to the Internet, which means that in order to continue the
      company's mission of connecting the world, we have to focus on
      connectivity itself: finding a way to bring the remaining 60% of the
      world onto the Internet. This requires shifts in thinking, innovation in
      technology and above all else, finding a way to scale this technology so
      that we can provide as much to as many with the lowest cost. In this talk
      I'll discuss how Facebook is using a multifaceted approach to this
      problem, from terrestrial projects like Terragraph and ARIES, which focus
      on providing efficient, fast, cheap and scalable wireless Internet for
      dense urban areas, to UAVs and satellites, like the Aquila project, aimed
      at connecting rural communities not already reached by cellular networks.
      This talk will discuss how these projects have pushed the boundaries of
      networking in both hardware and software, as well as the lessons learnt
      along the way. Also lasers.

      </p>
      <p>
      Over the last 2 years, we've worked hard to update our infrastructure

      <p>
      We've used this new infrastructure to host hundreds of websites for

      Scaling Support by Educating Customers
    abstract: >
      Growing a business does not just imply selling more products and
      getting more customers; one of the biggest challenges is supporting
      that growing customer-base in handling their acquired products. With
      growth comes an increase in potential errors, bugs, and struggles.
      So how does a growing tech company scale support?
      </p>
      <p>
      At WooThemes we get about 10,000 ticket submissions per month,
      which stands in big contrast with the almost 500,000 visitors of
      our public support resources. This talk will focus on finding a
      good balance between providing a stable public resource and answering
      urgent ticket requests, and the mistakes and wins we've
      encountered along the way.

    abstract: >
      Etsy is an online marketplace that connects people across the globe
      to buy and sell handmade and vintage goods. Founded in 2005 in
      Brooklyn, Etsy has grown rapidly. As a result, Etsy has need to
      scale its infrastructure to serve its growing user-base as well
      as its developers. In this talk, Bethany Macri, Core Platform
      Engineer at Etsy, will discuss three software projects that
      demonstrate how Etsy changed its infrastructure to scale and
      maintain high availability:
      <ol>
      <li>a four-year data migration project</li>
      <li>writing a new API that allowed clients to fetch data concurrently, and</li>
      <li>scaling datasets infrastructure.</li>
      </ol>
      This talk will propose a model for scaling as well as discussing
      possible ways Etsy will continue to scale as it grows.

        Containers will not fix your broken culture (and other hard truths)
    abstract: >
        Containers will not fix your broken culture. Microservices won’t
        prevent your two-pizza teams from needing to have conversations
        with one another over that pizza. No amount of industrial-strength
        job scheduling makes your organization immune to Conway’s Law.
        </p>
        <p>
        Does this mean that devops has failed? Not in the slightest.
        It means that while the unscrupulous might try to sell us devops,
        we can’t buy it. We have to live it; change is a choice we make
        every day, through our actions of listening empathetically and
        acting compassionately.
        </p>
        <p>
        Making thoughtful decisions about tools and architecture can help.
        Containers prove to be a useful boundary object, and deconstructing
        systems to human-scale allows us to comprehend their complexity.
        We succeed when we share responsibility and have agency, when we
        move past learned helplessness to active listening. But there is
        no flowchart, no checklist, no shopping list of ticky boxes that
        will make everything better. “Anyone who says differently is
        selling something”, as The Princess Bride teaches us.
        </p>
        <p>
        Part rant, part devops therapy, this talk will explain in the
        nerdiest of terms why CAP theorem applies to human interactions
        too, how oral tradition is like never writing state to disk, and
        what we can do to avoid sadness as a service.

        Load Balancing is Impossible
    abstract: >
        Load balancing is something most of us assume is a solved problem.
        But the idea that load balancing is "solved" could not be further
        from the truth. If you use multiple load balancers, the problem is
        even worse. Most of us use "random" or "round-robin" techniques,
        which have certain advantages but are highly inefficient. Others
        use more complex algorithms like "least-conns," which can be more
        efficient but have horrific edge cases. "Consistent hashing" is a
        very useful technique, but only applies to certain problems. There
        are several factors that exist both in theory and practice that
        make efficient load balancing an exceptionally hard problem.
        </p>
        <p>
        For instance:
        <ul>
        <li>Poisson request arrival times</li>
        <li>Exponentially distributed response latency</li>
        <li>Oscillations when sharing data between multiple load balancers</li>
        </ul>
        Luckily, there are techniques and algorithms that have been
        developed that can make life better. I’ll walk through some of the
        ways that we can do better than “random,” “round-robin,” and naive
        “least-conns,” even with distributed load balancers.

        through high school and into academia, where he spent a lot of time learning details
        like quantum mechanics and general relativity. Somehow he completed an MSc in Applied
        Mathematics, despite discovering the wonders of Linux and open-source software in
        the middle. Since leaving academia, Simon has written code for a variety of commercial
        and scientific projects ranging from online newspapers to petrochemical companies and
        from bioinformatics to radio astronomy. In his spare time Simon contributes to and
        maintains a number of open source software projects, writes the odd computer game

        as an expression of design. The same goes for architecture too - it''s all design.
        The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very, very hard,
        because achieving a harmonious balance is difficult.  The same with scalability
        - it throws us into extreme states, way off balance.  That is the challenge

        We can make servers look alike with Puppet, Chef, Ansible and most

        that, we believe or hope.  Yet, at ScaleConf 2013, I noticed that every
        company that told their story increases people proportional to
        increases in servers.  How did that work out?  Did we make all people
        the same - like our servers? Do we want that in the first instance?
        And if we don't want clones, what do we want? How do we scale a culture
        if value diversity?  Which emerges first - consistency in values, or
        consistency in technology? What is the tail that is wagging a body?  I
        will explore these and other challenges - the really tough stuff that
        continuous delivery pipelines don't solve.  I hope you will help me
        answer those questions?  I believe that when we understand this, we can
        achieve scale and balance. That's what I'm after - equilibrium at
        scale.

        sending millions of notifications simultaneously. Notification hubs take a
        different approach: they're based on pub/sub and designed to elastically
        scale. They provide message templates for personalization and a single API
        across iOS, Android and Windows.

    abstract: >
        For Facebook’s 10 year anniversary, we produced over 700 million
        personalized “look back” videos. Without any marketing or promotions
        within Facebook, these videos were shared by hundreds of millions
        of people in the first two days. To make this happen, we scanned
        through billions of years of timelines and pre-rendered petabytes of
        videos. I’ll talk about how the videos were rendered and the systems
        used to scale it, how we managed to do this in just 3 weeks, including
        a few days for the infrastructure just to compute and store the output,
        and how Facebook's company culture enabled a group of relative
        strangers to band together and iterate quickly on solutions for this
        frankly herculean project.

        Daniel is a Software Engineer in Etsy's infrastructure and development tools
        team. Automation, documentation and simplicity are his usual tools for
        improving the status quo. He previously worked in systems and network
        administration, on connecting chemical plants to IT systems and as an embedded
        systems networking engineer. Things he thoroughly enjoys when not writing code
        include coffee, breakfast, TV shows and basketball.
    title: Scaling Deployment at Etsy
    abstract: >
        At Etsy we have over 100 engineers deploying more than 40 times a day. This
        culture of continuously deploying small change sets enables us to build and
        release robust features all while serving over a billion page views per month.
        In order to make sure we can keep up this pace, we have development and
        deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to
        make changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on
        your first day - even if you're a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how is it possible to deploy so frequently among so many engineers and yet
        maintain a stable system? To answer this I give a high-level overview of the
        basic application structure to introduce the specific architecture we have at
        Etsy and how our development environment is set up. For development, every
        engineer gets their own VM with the full application stack configured. This
        makes it easy to get started and puts every developer in the same, familiar
        setup. This is a crucial part in removing confusion and ambiguity about how to
        work on and deploy changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the actual deployment we use a one-button deploy system - Deployinator -
        which we developed and opensourced. We integrated our system tightly with our
        company-wide IRC server and a set of tools we built to foster confidence,
        fast feedback and easy communication and collaboration between engineers. A
        detailed overview will be given on how the system works, how we use it and
        what problems we had to solve while making sure everyone can deploy as easily
        and fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The central source of confidence in our development process is our CI system.
        We have developed an easy way for developers to run tests on the CI cluster
        while developing to test changes before going into the deploy pipeline.
        Additionally tests are run on deploy and initiated by engineers with a tool
        called 'try' across 200 build machines. Our cluster setup is explained along
        with what problems we hit with an ever-growing codebase and number of
        engineers, and how we made our current setup fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        Continuous Deployment and the ability to quickly make changes are crucial for
        moving fast and iterating on products. Our deployment system works very well
        and is keeping up with the demands of a growing site and team. After attending
        this talk you will understand exactly how we approach Continuous Deployment
        and Continuous Integration at Etsy and get insight into what went wrong along
        the way and how we fixed it.

    title: Performance Testing Crash Course
    abstract: >
        The performance of your application affects your business more than you might think.
        Top engineering organizations think of performance not as a nice-to-have, but as a
        crucial feature of their product. Those organizations understand that performance
        has a direct impact on user experience and, ultimately, their bottom line. Unfortunately,
        most engineering teams do not regularly test the performance and scalability of
        their infrastructure. Dustin Whittle shares the latest performance testing tools
        and insights into why your team should add performance testing to the development
        process. Learn how to evaluate performance and scalability on the server-side and
        the client-side with tools like Siege, Bees with Machine Guns, Google PageSpeed,
        WBench, and more. Take back an understanding of how to automate performance and

    title: Let's build a solid base for a scale.
    abstract: >
        Creating fast, reliable and easy to develop systems is not the easiest task.
        If you add the fact that thousands of companies use your system as a core business
        platform on a daily basis, it becomes challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
        Add a flavour of a scalability and millions of users and it moves on to exciting.
        How can we prepare a system that might be affected by scalability issues
        everywhere, even in the simplest component?
        </p>
        <p>
        The answer is to dive deep into the world of services.
        We decided to prepare a strong base on top of which we can build our
        system. Our choice was to start with the Java stack.
        We've gathered all the cool stuff from open source projects to create a bootstrap
        to let our developers create scalable services really fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this talk I would like to focus on the choices we made, and the
        ecosystem we built over our services.  It is not only about the code we
        write, but also the tools that make our life easier.  We will look at
        frameworks to provide REST services, and see how to make them auto
        discoverable.  We will also discuss tools to let us monitor and manage
        all the instancesi we run.  If you want to create or upgrade your service
        to scale it is the best place to start.

        Shai is always excited when there is something new to learn, and
        hence has seemed to have found his fit doing technology.
        He started out playing with Ruby and Rails over 8 years ago.
        After helping scale and support some of the largest Ruby production
        systems around, he moved on to engineering in one of the leading
        Platform as a Services (PaaS) companies. Shai enjoys solving problems,
        facing new challenges and playing jazz standards when he's not finding
        out something new on his laptop.
    title: Such Blocking, Very Concurrency, Wow
    abstract: >
        Concurrency is fundamentally at the base of scaling. How do you manage
        to do more things at once? Well, you do them at the same time. This opens
        a huge can of worms though, because every different approach to how you do
        this has disadvantages, weaknesses, problems and tradeoffs. I will go
        through some approaches to concurrency that I've come across, speak of
        common building blocks and issues that these approaches all share. I'll
        be mentioning things like the c10k problem, threads, actors, evented
        programming, interacting with IO, futures/promises, coroutines and more.

        Far from being a world-renowned expert on the matter, I will attempt to dissect
        these patterns and styles because I want to understand why they "scale,"
        problems you can run across, and when (pun intended!) it can drive you crazy.
        Hopefully by the end you will find it somewhat easier to understand and grasp,
        and have a newly driven passion to dig in further.

        Simon started out life as an astronomer, used to be an engineer, and is now
        trying to avoid managerial tasks. Currently in charge of scientific
        computing for the MeerKAT radio telescope (www.ska.ac.za), he spends a
        significant amount of his coding time trying to avoid writing C, and
        the rest of the time trying to use sys._getframe() in ways that annoy
        his colleagues.
    title: Scale at the Square Kilometer Array
    abstract: >
        <p>
        Astronomy is one of the most scale obsessed of all the sciences.
        From our earliest attempts to understand the size of our planet through
        solar observations, through to our current appreciation of the ultimate
        scale of the universe, it constantly redefines our notion of "big".
        </p>
        <p>
        This escalation in scale can also be seen in our observational
        instruments, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. We are
        entering an epoch of massive expansion in observational capacity, which
        over the next 10 years we will see an 8 order of magnitude increase in
        the data volume being generated. This talk will focus on these
        instruments, their challenges, and what they will mean to the science
        of astronomy.

        Patrick Turley, an ex radio DJ now software developer will take us
        through the evolution of scaling testing on a software project as he
        has seen it over dozens of enterprise software projects.  He will
        discuss techniques and tools for different languages, all projected
        through a mixed tape that he made for this conference.

        Peter is responsible for product strategy, business development and general
        getting-things-done at 2go Interactive. His background is in the ISP
        industry, networking, internet security and systems architecture. His

        Founded in 2008, 2go has grown to more than 10 million active users
        across Africa, principally South Africa and Nigeria. As a mobile social
        network with 30,000 new registrations each day, scaling is the
        principle challenge of running 2go - both in terms of technology and
        growing a self-funded startup.
