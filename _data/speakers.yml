      Asynchronous Computing @ FB: Driving efficiency & developer productivity at Facebook scale
    abstract: >
      A lot of work happens behind the scenes that requires time and processing that should not block real-time actions in our products. Things like notifications, events' invites and video rendering may entail long waits or requires a large amount of processing power. This talk details how Facebook handles asynchronous processing at large scale, and the challenges that come with maintaining the reliability of a large multi-tenant system constantly growing in demand.

The same with scalability - it throws us into extreme states, way off balance, struggling to find the supply to meet the demand. These days Aslam tries to bind strategy and code with the shortest and tautest of strings, finding the least that we can do to fulfil a strategic intent.

      Many teams have a scaling problem that is relative to their business or industry, which is a long way off from the massively scaled companies such as Facebook and co. Many of these teams are inadvertently over-engineering for their needs. We need to learn to scale down right, simple as possible.

      Scaling Silos: Distributing Knowledge
    abstract: >
       In a distributed cloud world, we are frequently talking about how to scale our systems so that they are reliable, resilient, and fault-tolerant. But these concepts don't just apply to the computational aspect. A somewhat unconventional experiment of trying to work for a month without using StackOverflow showed that we can actually reuse the concepts we are already familiar with and apply them to the way we share knowledge within our teams.

      Hacking and Defending Systems at Scale
    abstract: >
      During the last 18 years of hacking systems and networks, hacking could be described as "looking for the one place somebody screwed up". This is premised on the idea that scale aids an attacker, because even a low incidence of security screw ups, turns into ample fodder at scale. Modern tools were going to save us. If we could deploy infrastructure as code, applying patches is as simple as rebuilding our Docker/Packer image, or updating one line in our Chef recipe. Containerisation means we can have security boundaries around our microservices, so a compromise of one, doesn't lead to a compromise of the whole application. And large infrastructure providers means best in the world security teams that can lock down their infrastructure. In this talk, we'd like to discuss the common security flaws we see in large networks (with some anecdotes from our own experiences) and ways of designing networks and systems to avoid them (also with some anecdotes).

      How to Properly Blame Things for Causing Latency: An Introduction to

      Latency analysis is the act of blaming components for causing user
      perceptible delay. In today's world of microservices, this can be
      tricky as requests can fan out across polyglot components and even
      data-centers. In many cases, the root source of latency isn't a
      component, but rather a link between components.
      </p><p>
      This session will overview how to debug latency problems, using call
      graphs created by Zipkin.  While we're at it, we'll discuss how the
      model works, and how to safely trace production. We'll demo with an
      example app you can download, using spring boot with spring cloud
      sleuth. Finally, we'll overview the ecosystem, including tools to

      Facebook’s user-base is quickly approaching the total number of users

      connectivity itself: finding a way to bring the remaining 60% of the
      world onto the Internet. This requires shifts in thinking, innovation in
      technology and above all else, finding a way to scale this technology so
      that we can provide as much to as many with the lowest cost. In this talk
      I'll discuss how Facebook is using a multifaceted approach to this
      problem, from terrestrial projects like Terragraph and ARIES, which focus

      In my presentation, I’ll talk you through the project, and describe our
      solution to this challenging problem.  I’ll recall some of the design
      decisions we made early on, and comment on what we got right.  More
      interestingly, I’ll remember fondly what we got wrong and what we’ve
      learned along the way.
      </p><p>
      I’ll look in detail at our home-grown NoSQL document store, and the
      block-based storage service that supports it.  I’ll discuss the very high
      performance and availability targets we set for ourselves, and describe
      how we approached them.  And I’ll speculate about the problems we still
      need to solve.

      The BBC’s websites and mobile apps are used by hundreds of millions of people
      each week. News, video, entertainment and much more is offered in dozens of
      languages to users around the world. But this breadth of content and audience
      size has meant some big scaling challenges. To solve this, the BBC has
      embraced microservices: small, easy-to-understand systems that can easily
      scale and combine to create powerful solutions.
      </p><p>
      In this talk, Matthew will describe how the BBC has designed and built its
      microservices architecture. Principles such as simplicity and sharing, combined
      with technology such as Node.JS and the cloud, have created a compelling
      approach: microservices that are quick and easy to make, fast and reliable, and
      globally scalable. The talk will look at how the BBC architects and runs its
      microservices, including the lessons learned, and what the future holds next.

      Edge compute — the idea of executing logic close to users, rather than in
      a central system — is at the stone age of its history. What we consider
      cutting edge today is only the beginning; with new products like Amazon
      Lambda, the idea of pushing logic to the edge of the network has started
      to become more mainstream. However, the big innovations are yet to come.
      What would it take to build complete, complex applications at the edge?
      What new, state-of-the-art tools and concepts would we need? We will
      discuss where the edge is heading over the next several years, some ideas

      Open source tools from companies such as Mesosphere, CoreOS and

      Software container systems such as Docker have drastically simplified
      the way these applications are packaged and executed.
      </p>
      <p>
      Over the last 2 years, we've worked hard to update our infrastructure
      from a complex set of manually-coordinated processes to an automated
      system that deploys Docker containers to a cluster. We made this move
      to reduce costs, scale further and make our software more portable.
      </p>
      <p>
      We've used this new infrastructure to host hundreds of websites for
      Facebook's Free Basics platform. Our new health software stack,
      Seed, has pushed the requirements of the infrastructure even further.
      We're working towards replicating this stack to deployments in
      countries across the world.

      <p>
      The talk will cover some of the basic building blocks of cluster
      orchestration systems such as consensus algorithms, distributed
      key/value stores and resource allocation. We'll cover some of the
      challenges in networking containers at scale and touch on some

        Containers will not fix your broken culture. Microservices won’t
        prevent your two-pizza teams from needing to have conversations
        with one another over that pizza. No amount of industrial-strength
        job scheduling makes your organization immune to Conway’s Law.
        </p>
        <p>
        Does this mean that devops has failed? Not in the slightest.
        It means that while the unscrupulous might try to sell us devops,
        we can’t buy it. We have to live it; change is a choice we make
        every day, through our actions of listening empathetically and
        acting compassionately.
        </p>
        <p>
        Making thoughtful decisions about tools and architecture can help.
        Containers prove to be a useful boundary object, and deconstructing
        systems to human-scale allows us to comprehend their complexity.
        We succeed when we share responsibility and have agency, when we
        move past learned helplessness to active listening. But there is
        no flowchart, no checklist, no shopping list of ticky boxes that

        Tyler McMullen is CTO at Fastly, where he’s responsible for the

        As part of the founding team, Tyler built the first versions of

        Before Fastly, Tyler worked on text analysis and recommendations

        experience in everything from web design to kernel development,
        and loathes all of it. Especially distributed systems.

        Load Balancing is Impossible
    abstract: >
        Load balancing is something most of us assume is a solved problem.
        But the idea that load balancing is "solved" could not be further
        from the truth. If you use multiple load balancers, the problem is
        even worse. Most of us use "random" or "round-robin" techniques,
        which have certain advantages but are highly inefficient. Others
        use more complex algorithms like "least-conns," which can be more
        efficient but have horrific edge cases. "Consistent hashing" is a
        very useful technique, but only applies to certain problems. There
        are several factors that exist both in theory and practice that
        make efficient load balancing an exceptionally hard problem.
        </p>
        <p>
        For instance:
        <ul>
        <li>Poisson request arrival times</li>
        <li>Exponentially distributed response latency</li>
        <li>Oscillations when sharing data between multiple load balancers</li>
        </ul>
        Luckily, there are techniques and algorithms that have been
        developed that can make life better. I’ll walk through some of the
        ways that we can do better than “random,” “round-robin,” and naive
        “least-conns,” even with distributed load balancers.

        The dirty secrets of building large, highly available, scalable HTTP APIs
    abstract: >
        When you first start building an API for a new product you mostly
        focus on getting an MVP ready, with the goal shipping as soon as
        possible so you can get feedback from customers. If you are lucky
        enough, your product will be successful and you will have to start
        worrying about things like authentication, authorization,
        documentation, validation, rate limiting, geo-redundancy, and
        no downtime deployments. In this talk I will go over some real
        life examples of our experience evolving our APIs at Auth0 and
        some of the tools we use for that.

        Some would say a CEO controls the vision, but NML’s vision is a composite
        of each individual that works there, so he just gets to edit it.
        Keeping an incredibly talented team close is his real goal – a talented team
        sells itself. To achieve this he strives to make New Media Labs a place the team
        want to spend their working life at. He sees employing people as an honour.

        coast and fortuitous early access to the GW-BASIC reference manual, he made his way
        through high school and into academia, where he spent a lot of time learning details
        like quantum mechanics and general relativity. Somehow he completed an MSc in Applied
        Mathematics, despite discovering the wonders of Linux and open-source software in
        the middle. Since leaving academia, Simon has written code for a variety of commercial
        and scientific projects ranging from online newspapers to petrochemical companies and
        from bioinformatics to radio astronomy. In his spare time Simon contributes to and
        maintains a number of open source software projects, writes the odd computer game

        caching the wrong way can bring down your site. If you're looking for a clear explanation
        about various caching techniques and tools like Memcached, Nginx and Varnish, as well as

        as an expression of design. The same goes for architecture too - it''s all design.
        The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very, very hard,
        because achieving a harmonious balance is difficult.  The same with scalability
        - it throws us into extreme states, way off balance.  That is the challenge
        - finding a new equilibrium.  You can read his blog at http://f3yourmind.net

        We can make servers look alike with Puppet, Chef, Ansible and most

        that, we believe or hope.  Yet, at ScaleConf 2013, I noticed that every
        company that told their story increases people proportional to
        increases in servers.  How did that work out?  Did we make all people
        the same - like our servers? Do we want that in the first instance?
        And if we don't want clones, what do we want? How do we scale a culture
        if value diversity?  Which emerges first - consistency in values, or
        consistency in technology? What is the tail that is wagging a body?  I
        will explore these and other challenges - the really tough stuff that
        continuous delivery pipelines don't solve.  I hope you will help me
        answer those questions?  I believe that when we understand this, we can
        achieve scale and balance. That's what I'm after - equilibrium at
        scale.

    title: Scaling push notifications to millions of devices

        Sending  notifications to millions of devices is quite challenging. Using
        native push notification services comes with the burdens of different APIs per
        platform, the need to manage the individual device registrations, the
        complexity of message personalization, and the need to massively scale when
        sending millions of notifications simultaneously. Notification hubs take a
        different approach: they're based on pub/sub and designed to elastically
        scale. They provide message templates for personalization and a single API
        across iOS, Android and Windows.

        deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to
        make changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on
        your first day - even if you're a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how is it possible to deploy so frequently among so many engineers and yet
        maintain a stable system? To answer this I give a high-level overview of the
        basic application structure to introduce the specific architecture we have at
        Etsy and how our development environment is set up. For development, every
        engineer gets their own VM with the full application stack configured. This
        makes it easy to get started and puts every developer in the same, familiar
        setup. This is a crucial part in removing confusion and ambiguity about how to
        work on and deploy changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the actual deployment we use a one-button deploy system - Deployinator -
        which we developed and opensourced. We integrated our system tightly with our
        company-wide IRC server and a set of tools we built to foster confidence,
        fast feedback and easy communication and collaboration between engineers. A
        detailed overview will be given on how the system works, how we use it and
        what problems we had to solve while making sure everyone can deploy as easily
        and fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The central source of confidence in our development process is our CI system.
        We have developed an easy way for developers to run tests on the CI cluster
        while developing to test changes before going into the deploy pipeline.
        Additionally tests are run on deploy and initiated by engineers with a tool
        called 'try' across 200 build machines. Our cluster setup is explained along
        with what problems we hit with an ever-growing codebase and number of
        engineers, and how we made our current setup fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        Continuous Deployment and the ability to quickly make changes are crucial for
        moving fast and iterating on products. Our deployment system works very well
        and is keeping up with the demands of a growing site and team. After attending
        this talk you will understand exactly how we approach Continuous Deployment
        and Continuous Integration at Etsy and get insight into what went wrong along
        the way and how we fixed it.

        The BrandsEye team have spent the last year or so transitioning from a
        single monolithic application with serious performance issues into a
        loosely coupled collection of applications able to handle very much
        higher volumes at far greater reliability. The new system uses a lot of
        interesting technology (RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgresql,
        Grails, Java, etc.) to solve various real-world problems. In this talk
        David goes into detail on the challenges and learnings encountered

    title: Performance Testing Crash Course
    abstract: >
        The performance of your application affects your business more than you might think.
        Top engineering organizations think of performance not as a nice-to-have, but as a
        crucial feature of their product. Those organizations understand that performance
        has a direct impact on user experience and, ultimately, their bottom line. Unfortunately,
        most engineering teams do not regularly test the performance and scalability of
        their infrastructure. Dustin Whittle shares the latest performance testing tools
        and insights into why your team should add performance testing to the development
        process. Learn how to evaluate performance and scalability on the server-side and
        the client-side with tools like Siege, Bees with Machine Guns, Google PageSpeed,
        WBench, and more. Take back an understanding of how to automate performance and
        load testing and evaluate the impact it has on performance and your business.

    title: Let's build a solid base for a scale.
    abstract: >
        Creating fast, reliable and easy to develop systems is not the easiest task.
        If you add the fact that thousands of companies use your system as a core business
        platform on a daily basis, it becomes challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
        Add a flavour of a scalability and millions of users and it moves on to exciting.
        How can we prepare a system that might be affected by scalability issues
        everywhere, even in the simplest component?
        </p>
        <p>
        The answer is to dive deep into the world of services.
        We decided to prepare a strong base on top of which we can build our
        system. Our choice was to start with the Java stack.
        We've gathered all the cool stuff from open source projects to create a bootstrap
        to let our developers create scalable services really fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this talk I would like to focus on the choices we made, and the
        ecosystem we built over our services.  It is not only about the code we
        write, but also the tools that make our life easier.  We will look at
        frameworks to provide REST services, and see how to make them auto
        discoverable.  We will also discuss tools to let us monitor and manage
        all the instancesi we run.  If you want to create or upgrade your service
        to scale it is the best place to start.

        "failure-is-not-an-option" projects, with extraordinarily limited time and
        resources. Both teams nailed it: every space geek in the world saw the Mars
        Curiosity Rover's first images live from Amazon S3 and Cloudfront and
        watched an HD live-stream of the event, and the 170+ custom applications on

    title: Such Blocking, Very Concurrency, Wow
    abstract: >
        Concurrency is fundamentally at the base of scaling. How do you manage
        to do more things at once? Well, you do them at the same time. This opens
        a huge can of worms though, because every different approach to how you do
        this has disadvantages, weaknesses, problems and tradeoffs. I will go
        through some approaches to concurrency that I've come across, speak of
        common building blocks and issues that these approaches all share. I'll
        be mentioning things like the c10k problem, threads, actors, evented
        programming, interacting with IO, futures/promises, coroutines and more.

        Far from being a world-renowned expert on the matter, I will attempt to dissect
        these patterns and styles because I want to understand why they "scale,"
        problems you can run across, and when (pun intended!) it can drive you crazy.
        Hopefully by the end you will find it somewhat easier to understand and grasp,
        and have a newly driven passion to dig in further.

    title: Scale at the Square Kilometer Array
    abstract: >
        <p>
        Astronomy is one of the most scale obsessed of all the sciences.
        From our earliest attempts to understand the size of our planet through
        solar observations, through to our current appreciation of the ultimate
        scale of the universe, it constantly redefines our notion of "big".
        </p>
        <p>
        This escalation in scale can also be seen in our observational
        instruments, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. We are
        entering an epoch of massive expansion in observational capacity, which
        over the next 10 years we will see an 8 order of magnitude increase in
        the data volume being generated. This talk will focus on these
        instruments, their challenges, and what they will mean to the science

      I will discuss the methodologies and best practices that are required in order to be scalable, and describe the common mistakes they will temper, and why they should be implemented immediately.

      This type of scaling presents some interesting technical challenges. I'll dig into our development workflow and how we address concepts like scaling, deployment, code review, and testing.

      It also presents some interesting business challenges, too. How you grow your company from three employees, how you work in teams, and how you split your app up into services all help ensure that you'll be able to react to your product's growth.

      Deon designs and builds infrastructure, and has extensive experience in deploying and integrating bespoke platforms into all kinds of environments. Largely focused on networking, firewalls, storage and virtualisation, he sometimes pretends to know stuff about Oracle, Solaris and Linux. He holds an Asterisk certification issued by Digium themselves, but intensely dislikes telephony and being telephoned. Lately he has been dabbling in application delivery networking voodoo and cultivating tasty vegetables for own consumption.

    abstract: >
      Sometimes, hosting your new web or mobile app in the cloud may not be an option, and you'll be faced with the challenge of building your own infrastructure and hosting it somewhere. Being a startup, chances are you are short on cash, already wearing several hats, and inexperienced with the hard stuff. How do you go about designing, sizing, specifying, procuring, implementing, deploying and monitoring the infrastructure for your new app, with a limited budget, and without compromising its ability to scale when your new service takes off? Practical advice, proven configurations and common pitfalls are covered in this talk.

    abstract: >
      2go has developed a hugely successful mobile social network around its 2go Messenger; a network that has grown to 15 million users across Africa in just a few years. If rapid infrastructure scaling doesn't present enough challenges, doing so in an emerging market only makes it more interesting. Ashley will share techniques used and lessons learned during 2go's growth and what is planned for the future.

    title: Learning to Fail
    abstract: >
      Building applications for scale in emerging markets such as Africa, while terribly exciting, can be an incredibly uncomfortable exercise. Not only from a perspective of the technical challenges but just as much from a team perspective. One of the keys to staying sane is admitting that we all write terrible code, dreadfully hacky workarounds and resort to incredibly poor solutions all the time. I'll be talking about our experience in failure at Praekelt and how that adds value to what we do and the impact we aim to have.

      Distributed systems aren't limited to the world of computing. Companies and communities, for example, are also distributed networks of resources. In this talk, we'll take a high-level look at computers, companies, and communities as distributed systems and examine why maintaining their health is crucial if they are to scale.
