        <b>Clearly I Have Made Some Bad Decisions</b>
        <p>
        Too often in the organization of this conference we have heard "but I don't have scalability issues".
        </p>
        <p>
        This talk discusses what scalability issues actually are, and details why we all inevitably have them.  Avoiding them, or delaying solutions until they are unavoidable, leads to making many bad "temporary" decisions that cannot be fixed further down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
        I will discuss the methodologies and best practices that are required in order to be scalable, and describe the common mistakes they will temper, and why they should be implemented immediately.
        Finally, I will briefly touch on how to deal with rectifying the bad decisions that we all inevitably make, no matter how forward-thinking we are.

        <b>Scaling GitHub</b>
        <p>
        A month after launching, GitHub hosted one thousand repositories. Three years later, we host over three million. In the same time we've gone from one thousand users to over a million.
        </p>
        <p>
        This type of scaling presents some interesting technical challenges. I'll dig into our development workflow and how we address concepts like scaling, deployment, code review, and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
        It also presents some interesting business challenges, too. How you grow your company from three employees, how you work in teams, and how you split your app up into services all help ensure that you'll be able to react to your product's growth.

        <b>Highly available infrastructure on the cheap</b>
        <p>Sometimes, hosting your new web or mobile app in the cloud may not be an option, and you'll be faced with the challenge of building your own infrastructure and hosting it somewhere. Being a startup, chances are you are short on cash, already wearing several hats, and inexperienced with the hard stuff. How do you go about designing, sizing, specifying, procuring, implementing, deploying and monitoring the infrastructure for your new app, with a limited budget, and without compromising its ability to scale when your new service takes off? Practical advice, proven configurations and common pitfalls are covered in this talk.</p>

        2go has developed a hugely successful mobile social network around its 2go Messenger; a network that has grown to 15 million users across Africa in just a few years. If rapid infrastructure scaling doesn't present enough challenges, doing so in an emerging market only makes it more interesting. Ashley will share techniques used and lessons learned during 2go's growth and what is planned for the future.

        <b>Learning to Fail</b>
        <p>
            Building applications for scale in emerging markets such as Africa, while terribly exciting, can be an incredibly uncomfortable exercise. Not only from a perspective of the technical challenges but just as much from a team perspective. One of the keys to staying sane is admitting that we all write terrible code, dreadfully hacky workarounds and resort to incredibly poor solutions all the time. I'll be talking about our experience in failure at Praekelt and how that adds value to what we do and the impact we aim to have.

        <b>The programming ape</b>
        <p>
        Humans, you may have noticed, are not exactly rational. And yet here we are, trying to get them to build software. It's a bit of a mess. But there is some good news: by drawing on modern theories of human cognition we can begin to optimize our tools for how people think, not how computers work. I'll talk about our experience at Yammer building human-centric tools for engineers, lay out the sociotechnical challenges facing organizations trying to build transparent architectures, and mention in passing how all of this relates to making money.

        <b>Building Healthy Distributed Systems</b>
		<p>Distributed systems aren't limited to the world of computing. Companies and communities, for example, are also distributed networks of resources. In this talk, we'll take a high-level look at computers, companies, and communities as distributed systems and examine why maintaining their health is crucial if they are to scale.</p>
