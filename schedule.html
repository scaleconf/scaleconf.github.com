        <b>Clearly I Have Made Some Bad Decisions</b>
        <p>
        Too often in the organization of this conference I have heard "but I don't have scalability issues".  We all thought that at one point, and thought we could fix them when we got there.  This has lead to making many bad "temporary" decisions that you are then stuck with because it's too hard to fix them down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
        This talk provides an overview of the sorts of issues you need to take into account, some of the methodologies and best practices you should implement, and briefly touches on how to go about rectifying the bad decisions that we all inevitable make.

        A collection of some of my learnings from a decade of building and hosting websites and web applications for one of Africa's largest digital agencies. It will cover areas such as languages, persistence, infrastructure architecture and scaling your team.

        <b>Scaling GitHub</b>
        <p>
        A month after launching, GitHub hosted one thousand repositories. Three years later, we host over three million. In the same time we've gone from one thousand users to over a million.
        </p>
        <p>
        This type of scaling presents some interesting technical challenges. I'll dig into our development workflow and how we address concepts like scaling, deployment, code review, and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
        It also presents some interesting business challenges, too. How you grow your company from three employees, how you work in teams, and how you split your app up into services all help ensure that you'll be able to react to your product's growth.

        <b>Learning to Fail</b>
        <p>
            Building applications for scale in emerging markets such as Africa, while terribly exciting, can be an incredibly uncomfortable exercise. Not only from a perspective of the technical challenges but just as much from a team perspective. One of the keys to staying sane is admitting that we all write terrible code, dreadfully hacky workarounds and resort to incredibly poor solutions all the time. I'll be talking about our experience in failure at Praekelt and how that adds value to what we do and the impact we aim to have.

        <b>The programming ape</b>
        <p>
        Humans, you may have noticed, are not exactly rational. And yet here we are, trying to get them to build software. It's a bit of a mess. But there is some good news: by drawing on modern theories of human cognition we can begin to optimize our tools for how people think, not how computers work. I'll talk about our experience at Yammer building human-centric tools for engineers, lay out the sociotechnical challenges facing organizations trying to build transparent architectures, and mention in passing how all of this relates to making money.
