                        <p>Too often in the organization of this conference we have heard "but I don't have scalability issues". This talk discusses what scalability issues actually are, and details why we all inevitably have them. Avoiding them, or delaying solutions until they are unavoidable, leads to making many bad "temporary" decisions that cannot be fixed further down the line.</p>

                        <p>I will discuss the methodologies and best practices that are required in order to be scalable, and describe the common mistakes they will temper, and why they should be implemented immediately. Finally, I will briefly touch on how to deal with rectifying the bad decisions that we all inevitably make, no matter how forward-thinking we are. </p>

                        <p>A month after launching, GitHub hosted one thousand repositories. Three years later, we host over three million. In the same time we've gone from one thousand users to over a million.</p>

                        <p>This type of scaling presents some interesting technical challenges. I'll dig into our development workflow and how we address concepts like scaling, deployment, code review, and testing.</p>

                        <p>It also presents some interesting business challenges, too. How you grow your company from three employees, how you work in teams, and how you split your app up into services all help ensure that you'll be able to react to your product's growth.</p>
