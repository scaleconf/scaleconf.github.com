            With such a strong technically focused conference, we have decided
            to once again run some free workshops alongside the conference.
            These are informal hackathon-style workshops where engineers from the sponsoring company will be on hand to walk you through getting started on their products or services. 
        </p>

            This year's workshops are not yet confirmed, so check back again soon, or follow us on Twitter for updates.
