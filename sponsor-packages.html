            ScaleConf is organised by volunteers, but there are still huge expenses when
            it comes to putting together a successful conference. Sponsorship helps us to
            keep ticket prices affordable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've structured our sponsorship this year to make sure that you can build
            up the benefits in a way that makes sense for your company.
        </p>

        <p>If you want to take us up on one of the options then please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@scaleconf.org">info@scaleconf.org</a>.</p>

        <h3>Level up</h3>

        <p>Sponsors with the baseline package may want to build their package out a bit

        options which can be added to the baseline package.</p>

        <h4>Spotlight</h4>

        Three extra conference tickets

        Cost: R15,000 (&lt;convert&gt; USD)
        Space is the limiting factor here, so we will only be able to squeeze
        five spots into the venue.

        <h4>Adopt a Student</h4>

        <p>Cape Town is full of smart but penniless computer science students wanting to
        experience and learn from events like this. It is also such a great
        opportunity for them to meet engineers from your company, ask questions, and
        get involved.</p>

            <strong>Cost: R1,000 ($100)</strong>
