  aslam_khan:
    bio: >
        is an African software developer, by birth, by choice
        and for life.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code
        as an expression of design. The same goes for architecture too - it''s all design.
        The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very, very hard,
        because achieving a harmonious balance is difficult.  The same with scalability
        - it throws us into extreme states, way off balance.  That is the challenge
        - finding a new equilibrium.  You can read his blog at http://f3yourmind.net

    title: Scaling push notifications to millions of devices
    abstract: >
        Sending  notifications to millions of devices is quite challenging. Using
        native push notification services comes with the burdens of different APIs per
        platform, the need to manage the individual device registrations, the
        complexity of message personalization, and the need to massively scale when
        sending millions of notifications simultaneously. Notification hubs take a
        different approach: they're based on pub/sub and designed to elastically
        scale. They provide message templates for personalization and a single API
        across iOS, Android and Windows.

        software developer for one of the world’s first online casino groups, and
        in 2005 co-founded RightShift as a multiplayer FPS tournament business that
        later pivoted into social gaming in 2008 and (several apps later) launched
        Clickfun Casino in 2011.</p>
        <p>Bootstrapped entirely by the founders without any external funding, Daniel
        and his team have built out proprietary infrastructure capable of
        supporting millions of users. This experience together with his background

  daniel_schauenberg:

    quote: Automation, documentation and simplicity are his usual tools

    bio: >
        is a Software Engineer in Etsy's infrastructure and development tools
        team. Automation, documentation and simplicity are his usual tools for
        improving the status quo. He previously worked in systems and network
        administration, on connecting chemical plants to IT systems and as an embedded
        systems networking engineer. Things he thoroughly enjoys when not writing code
        include coffee, breakfast, TV shows and basketball.
    title: Scaling Deployment at Etsy
    abstract: >
        At Etsy we have over 100 engineers deploying more than 40 times a day. This
        culture of continuously deploying small change sets enables us to build and
        release robust features all while serving over a billion page views per month.
        In order to make sure we can keep up this pace, we have development and
        deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to
        make changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on
        your first day - even if you're a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how is it possible to deploy so frequently among so many engineers and yet
        maintain a stable system? To answer this I give a high-level overview of the
        basic application structure to introduce the specific architecture we have at
        Etsy and how our development environment is set up. For development, every
        engineer gets their own VM with the full application stack configured. This
        makes it easy to get started and puts every developer in the same, familiar
        setup. This is a crucial part in removing confusion and ambiguity about how to
        work on and deploy changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the actual deployment we use a one-button deploy system - Deployinator -
        which we developed and opensourced. We integrated our system tightly with our
        company-wide IRC server and a set of tools we built to foster confidence,
        fast feedback and easy communication and collaboration between engineers. A
        detailed overview will be given on how the system works, how we use it and
        what problems we had to solve while making sure everyone can deploy as easily
        and fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The central source of confidence in our development process is our CI system.
        We have developed an easy way for developers to run tests on the CI cluster
        while developing to test changes before going into the deploy pipeline.
        Additionally tests are run on deploy and initiated by engineers with a tool
        called 'try' across 200 build machines. Our cluster setup is explained along
        with what problems we hit with an ever-growing codebase and number of
        engineers, and how we made our current setup fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        Continuous Deployment and the ability to quickly make changes are crucial for
        moving fast and iterating on products. Our deployment system works very well
        and is keeping up with the demands of a growing site and team. After attending
        this talk you will understand exactly how we approach Continuous Deployment
        and Continuous Integration at Etsy and get insight into what went wrong along
        the way and how we fixed it.

        In 2012 two small teams set about delivering on massive expectations, on
        "failure-is-not-an-option" projects, with extraordinarily limited time and
        resources. Both teams nailed it: every space geek in the world saw the Mars
        Curiosity Rover's first images live from Amazon S3 and Cloudfront and
        watched an HD live-stream of the event, and the 170+ custom applications on

        <p>
        Astronomy is one of the most scale obsessed of all the sciences.
        From our earliest attempts to understand the size of our planet through
        solar observations, through to our current appreciation of the ultimate
        scale of the universe, it constantly redefines our notion of "big".
        </p>
        <p>
        This escalation in scale can also be seen in our observational
        instruments, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. We are
        entering an epoch of massive expansion in observational capacity, which
        over the next 10 years we will see an 8 order of magnitude increase in
        the data volume being generated. This talk will focus on these
