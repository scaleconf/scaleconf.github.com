    title: Scaling on Windows Azure
    abstract: >
        The Windows Azure architecture is based on scale-out and offers different
        scale-units to build large systems. In this session, we will discuss the
        capabilities for compute, distributed caching, storage and big data.

    name: Dale Humby
    company: Nomanini
    role: CTO
    country: SA

    bio: >
        Dale Humby is CTO of Nomanini, a Cape Town based startup that has
        developed a low cost, mobile point-of-sale terminal and the technology
        ecosystem for it to operate in informal markets. His genesis is as an
        electro-mechanical engineer developing sophisticated remote monitoring
        systems in his own start-up business, joining Nomanini at its inception
        in 2011 along with his staff.
        </p>
        <p>
        Dale is passionate about the processes of product development,
        continuous improvement, the motivation and management of people as well
        as the complex and challenging mechanism of implementing continuous
        delivery across hardware, firmware and software, all in an Agile
        context.
        </p>
        <p>
        Like his peers in Nomanini, Dale is driven by the twin goals of
        powering the needs of the micro-entrepreneur in Africa and the
        satisfaction of a job well done.
    title: >
        Scaling and Reliable Deployment of Hardware, Firmware and Software into the complex African micro-entrepreneurial market.
    abstract: >
        Nomanini's target market, mostly micro-entrepreneurs, rely on the
        Nomanini solution for their livelihood. Therefore Nomanini has to
        surmount the difficulties of building a scalable, repeatedly
        deliverable hardware, firmware and back-end software solution capable
        of processing millions of financial transactions in the technically
        difficult African environment.
        </p>
        <p>
        In his talk Dale discusses these challenges and reflects on solutions,
        lessons learned and future improvements.

    quote: Massively scalable systems for the gaming and gambling sectors
    twitter:
    bio: >
        has spent more than 15 years designing and building massively
        scalable systems for the gaming and gambling sectors. He began in 1997 as a
        software developer for one of the world’s first online casino groups, and
        in 2005 co-founded RightShift as a multiplayer FPS tournament business that
        later pivoted into social gaming in 2008 and (several apps later) launched
        Clickfun Casino in 2011.</p>
        <p>Bootstrapped entirely by the founders without any external funding, Daniel
        and his team have built out proprietary infrastructure capable of
        supporting millions of users. This experience together with his background
        in real money gaming gives Daniel a unique understanding of the overall
        gaming market and a perspective on the rapid convergence of social and real
        money gaming that few others are likely to have.
    title: Tales from the trenches
    abstract: >
        The story of how RightShift scaled its business and architecture to
        successfully compete in the competitive social casino arena with their
        flagship Clickfun Casino product. Daniel shares first-hand insight into
        scaling a modern business and high-volume platform and is as much an
        enlightening tale of getting things right as a cautionary tale of what not
        to do.

    bio: >
        is a Software Engineer in Etsy's infrastructure and development tools
        team. Automation, documentation and simplicity are his usual tools for
        improving the status quo. He previously worked in systems and network
        administration, on connecting chemical plants to IT systems and as an embedded
        systems networking engineer. Things he thoroughly enjoys when not writing code
        include coffee, breakfast, TV shows and basketball.
    title: Scaling Deployment at Etsy
    abstract: >
        At Etsy we have over 100 engineers deploying more than 40 times a day. This
        culture of continuously deploying small change sets enables us to build and
        release robust features all while serving over a billion page views per month.
        In order to make sure we can keep up this pace, we have development and
        deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to
        make changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on
        your first day - even if you're a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how is it possible to deploy so frequently among so many engineers and yet
        maintain a stable system? To answer this I give a high-level overview of the
        basic application structure to introduce the specific architecture we have at
        Etsy and how our development environment is set up. For development, every
        engineer gets their own VM with the full application stack configured. This
        makes it easy to get started and puts every developer in the same, familiar
        setup. This is a crucial part in removing confusion and ambiguity about how to
        work on and deploy changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the actual deployment we use a one-button deploy system - Deployinator -
        which we developed and opensourced. We integrated our system tightly with our
        company-wide IRC server and a set of tools we built to foster confidence,
        fast feedback and easy communication and collaboration between engineers. A
        detailed overview will be given on how the system works, how we use it and
        what problems we had to solve while making sure everyone can deploy as easily
        and fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The central source of confidence in our development process is our CI system.
        We have developed an easy way for developers to run tests on the CI cluster
        while developing to test changes before going into the deploy pipeline.
        Additionally tests are run on deploy and initiated by engineers with a tool
        called 'try' across 200 build machines. Our cluster setup is explained along
        with what problems we hit with an ever-growing codebase and number of
        engineers, and how we made our current setup fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        Continuous Deployment and the ability to quickly make changes are crucial for
        moving fast and iterating on products. Our deployment system works very well
        and is keeping up with the demands of a growing site and team. After attending
        this talk you will understand exactly how we approach Continuous Deployment
        and Continuous Integration at Etsy and get insight into what went wrong along
        the way and how we fixed it.

        and analysis software. BrandsEye processes large volumes (3 million+) of
        tweets and other brand mentions every day, contextualising and annotating
        them with sentiment, credibility and so forth.
    title: Transitioning your architecture to scale
    abstract: >
        The BrandsEye team have spent the last year or so transitioning from a
        single monolithic application with serious performance issues into a
        loosely coupled collection of applications able to handle very much
        higher volumes at far greater reliability. The new system uses a lot of
        interesting technology (RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgresql,
        Grails, Java, etc.) to solve various real-world problems. In this talk
        David goes into detail on the challenges and learnings encountered
        along the way.

        a "jack of all trades, master of some", which really just means he has to

        conferences). Born and raised in London, but now resident in Cape Town with
        his growing family, he appreciates all that the city has to offer as an
        awesome place to build a socially valuable business.

        It has never been easy to turn your ideas into a real scalable business, but
        these days, with the rise of the tech incubator, it seems like it's
        something that everyone is meant to be doing. This talk hopes to provide
        some insight based on real-world experience from someone who has tried and
        failed a number of times, and in 2012 decided to try again right here in
        Cape Town.  Inspired by last year's ScaleConf, he'll tell us how

        hopefully happily send your mum to.

        Little teams with big results: NASA/JPL and Obama for America via AWS
    abstract: >
        In 2012 two small teams set about delivering on massive expectations, on
        "failure-is-not-an-option" projects, with extraordinarily limited time and
        resources. Both teams nailed it: every space geek in the world saw the Mars
        Curiosity Rover's first images live from Amazon S3 and Cloudfront and
        watched an HD live-stream of the event, and the 170+ custom applications on
        AWS powering the radical Obama for America campaign played no small part in
        helping President Obama win his bid for re-election.  Miles Ward, your
        presenter, worked embedded within these teams during the design, development,
        testing, deployment and operational phases of these projects, and can relay
        a few critical insights about the use of cloud at this scale.  100,000 WCU
