  craig_robinson:
    name: Craig Robinson
    company: Google
    role: Senior Software Engineer
    country: USA
    bio: >
        is Senior Software engineer on the Street View team at Google. After
        finishing a PhD in control theory (with a fair dose of CS) he spent
        some time developing <a
        href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/videos/tech-green-light-for-robotic-roads.htm">wireless
        vehicle to vehicle communication</a> applications for Mercedes-Benz
        Research and Development.  In 2009 he joined Street View and started
        work on estimating panorama location and orientation using onboard
        sensors (GPS, IMU, laser, wheels), computer vision (feature matches,
        loop closing), map matching and other hackery. He enjoys the fact that
        it's a multi-dimensional project that is both enabled and challenged by
        its scale. When he is not enjoying it, he goes running.
    title: Street View Scale
    abstract: >
        Google Street View began with a single video camera hand held by Larry
        Page. It launched in 2007 and covered 5 cities. Since then it has grown
        to span 7 continents and over 50 countries with 5 million unique miles
        driven and 20 petabytes of imagery captured. Collections now include
        indoor, underwater, snowmobile, backpack and bicycle. The scaling up
        has been a logistics and a software challenge and we will cover some of
        the highlights, low lights, software architectures and lessons learned
        in Street View and Google at large.

    bio: >
        Simon enjoys exploring details and finding ways to make the world a better place.
        From a childhood filled with weekends on the rocky beaches of South Africa’s west
        coast and fortuitous early access to the GW-BASIC reference manual, he made his way
        through high school and into academia, where he spent a lot of time learning details
        like quantum mechanics and general relativity. Somehow he completed an MSc in Applied
        Mathematics, despite discovering the wonders of Linux and open-source software in
        the middle. Since leaving academia, Simon has written code for a variety of commercial
        and scientific projects ranging from online newspapers to petrochemical companies and
        from bioinformatics to radio astronomy. In his spare time Simon contributes to and
        maintains a number of open source software projects, writes the odd computer game
        or two, engages in old-fashioned pen-and-paper gaming and tries to get out to the
        swimming pool or squash court every now and then. Simon is currently the lead
        developer of Vumi, a scalable mobile messaging platform developed by the Praekelt
        Foundation and recently organized the first two PyConZA conferences.

    title: Caching and Tuning fun for high scalability
    abstract: >
        Caching has been a 'hot' topic for a few years. But caching takes more than merely taking
        data and putting it in a cache : the right caching techniques can improve performance and
        reduce load significantly. But we'll also look at some major pitfalls, showing that
        caching the wrong way can bring down your site. If you're looking for a clear explanation
        about various caching techniques and tools like Memcached, Nginx and Varnish, as well as
        ways to deploy them in an efficient way, this talk is for you.

    title: Offloading the Rendering of your View to your Clients
    abstract: >
        Performance improvements in modern browsers coupled with the acceptance of javascript
        as a first class language gives us a compelling platform to move a bulk of what used
        to be done earlier on the server side to the client. This allows the distribution of
        processing power and removing some obvious bottlenecks on the server side. This talk
        aims to share our experience with the advantages of using this approach along with its
        limitations. We talk about single page web applications, client side consumption of
        RESTful services, performance gotchas, single code base for designers and developers
        and its effect on building a portable client and scalable server code.

    twitter: aslamkhn
    bio: >
        is an African software developer, by birth, by choice
        and for life.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code
        as an expression of design. The same goes for architecture too - it''s all design.
        The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very, very hard,
        because achieving a harmonious balance is difficult.  The same with scalability
        - it throws us into extreme states, way off balance.  That is the challenge
        - finding a new equilibrium.  You can read his blog at http://f3yourmind.net
    title: Puppet for Human Beings (not!)
    abstract: >
        We can make servers look alike with Puppet, Chef, Ansible and most
        probably other machinery that we are going to invent.  And it makes us
        happy, because we like conformity and consistency.  Life is easier like
        that, we believe or hope.  Yet, at ScaleConf 2013, I noticed that every
        company that told their story increases people proportional to
        increases in servers.  How did that work out?  Did we make all people
        the same - like our servers? Do we want that in the first instance?
        And if we don't want clones, what do we want? How do we scale a culture
        if value diversity?  Which emerges first - consistency in values, or
        consistency in technology? What is the tail that is wagging a body?  I
        will explore these and other challenges - the really tough stuff that
        continuous delivery pipelines don't solve.  I hope you will help me
        answer those questions?  I believe that when we understand this, we can
        achieve scale and balance. That's what I'm after - equilibrium at
        scale.

    title: Scaling push notifications to millions of devices
    abstract: >
        Sending  notifications to millions of devices is quite challenging. Using
        native push notification services comes with the burdens of different APIs per
        platform, the need to manage the individual device registrations, the
        complexity of message personalization, and the need to massively scale when
        sending millions of notifications simultaneously. Notification hubs take a
        different approach: they're based on pub/sub and designed to elastically
        scale. They provide message templates for personalization and a single API
        across iOS, Android and Windows.

    title: Looking back on “Look Back” videos
    abstract: >
        For Facebook’s 10 year anniversary, we produced over 700 million
        personalized “look back” videos. Without any marketing or promotions
        within Facebook, these videos were shared by hundreds of millions
        of people in the first two days. To make this happen, we scanned
        through billions of years of timelines and pre-rendered petabytes of
        videos. I’ll talk about how the videos were rendered and the systems
        used to scale it, how we managed to do this in just 3 weeks, including
        a few days for the infrastructure just to compute and store the output,
        and how Facebook's company culture enabled a group of relative
        strangers to band together and iterate quickly on solutions for this
        frankly herculean project.

        make an inverted index suitable for real time search, how to scale that out,
        how to add reliability and failover to the cluster, and design patterns to use
        the cluster most efficiently

        is a Software Engineer in Etsy's infrastructure and development tools
        team. Automation, documentation and simplicity are his usual tools for
        improving the status quo. He previously worked in systems and network
        administration, on connecting chemical plants to IT systems and as an embedded
        systems networking engineer. Things he thoroughly enjoys when not writing code
        include coffee, breakfast, TV shows and basketball.
    title: Scaling Deployment at Etsy
    abstract: >
        At Etsy we have over 100 engineers deploying more than 40 times a day. This
        culture of continuously deploying small change sets enables us to build and
        release robust features all while serving over a billion page views per month.
        In order to make sure we can keep up this pace, we have development and
        deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to
        make changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on
        your first day - even if you're a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how is it possible to deploy so frequently among so many engineers and yet
        maintain a stable system? To answer this I give a high-level overview of the
        basic application structure to introduce the specific architecture we have at
        Etsy and how our development environment is set up. For development, every
        engineer gets their own VM with the full application stack configured. This
        makes it easy to get started and puts every developer in the same, familiar
        setup. This is a crucial part in removing confusion and ambiguity about how to
        work on and deploy changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the actual deployment we use a one-button deploy system - Deployinator -
        which we developed and opensourced. We integrated our system tightly with our
        company-wide IRC server and a set of tools we built to foster confidence,
        fast feedback and easy communication and collaboration between engineers. A
        detailed overview will be given on how the system works, how we use it and
        what problems we had to solve while making sure everyone can deploy as easily
        and fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The central source of confidence in our development process is our CI system.
        We have developed an easy way for developers to run tests on the CI cluster
        while developing to test changes before going into the deploy pipeline.
        Additionally tests are run on deploy and initiated by engineers with a tool
        called 'try' across 200 build machines. Our cluster setup is explained along
        with what problems we hit with an ever-growing codebase and number of
        engineers, and how we made our current setup fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        Continuous Deployment and the ability to quickly make changes are crucial for
        moving fast and iterating on products. Our deployment system works very well
        and is keeping up with the demands of a growing site and team. After attending
        this talk you will understand exactly how we approach Continuous Deployment
        and Continuous Integration at Etsy and get insight into what went wrong along
        the way and how we fixed it.

    title: Performance Testing Crash Course
    abstract: >
        The performance of your application affects your business more than you might think.
        Top engineering organizations think of performance not as a nice-to-have, but as a
        crucial feature of their product. Those organizations understand that performance
        has a direct impact on user experience and, ultimately, their bottom line. Unfortunately,
        most engineering teams do not regularly test the performance and scalability of
        their infrastructure. Dustin Whittle shares the latest performance testing tools
        and insights into why your team should add performance testing to the development
        process. Learn how to evaluate performance and scalability on the server-side and
        the client-side with tools like Siege, Bees with Machine Guns, Google PageSpeed,
        WBench, and more. Take back an understanding of how to automate performance and
        load testing and evaluate the impact it has on performance and your business.

    title: Let's build a solid base for a scale.
    abstract: >
        Creating fast, reliable and easy to develop systems is not the easiest task.
        If you add the fact that thousands of companies use your system as a core business
        platform on a daily basis, it becomes challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
        Add a flavour of a scalability and millions of users and it moves on to exciting.
        How can we prepare a system that might be affected by scalability issues
        everywhere, even in the simplest component?
        </p>
        <p>
        The answer is to dive deep into the world of services.
        We decided to prepare a strong base on top of which we can build our
        system. Our choice was to start with the Java stack.
        We've gathered all the cool stuff from open source projects to create a bootstrap
        to let our developers create scalable services really fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this talk I would like to focus on the choices we made, and the
        ecosystem we built over our services.  It is not only about the code we
        write, but also the tools that make our life easier.  We will look at
        frameworks to provide REST services, and see how to make them auto
        discoverable.  We will also discuss tools to let us monitor and manage
        all the instancesi we run.  If you want to create or upgrade your service
        to scale it is the best place to start.

        something that everyone is meant to be doing. This talk hopes to provide
        some insight based on real-world experience from someone who has tried and
        failed a number of times, and in 2012 decided to try again right here in
        Cape Town.  Inspired by last year's ScaleConf, he'll tell us how

        Little teams with big results: NASA/JPL and Obama for America via AWS
    abstract: >
        In 2012 two small teams set about delivering on massive expectations, on
        "failure-is-not-an-option" projects, with extraordinarily limited time and
        resources. Both teams nailed it: every space geek in the world saw the Mars
        Curiosity Rover's first images live from Amazon S3 and Cloudfront and
        watched an HD live-stream of the event, and the 170+ custom applications on
        AWS powering the radical Obama for America campaign played no small part in
        helping President Obama win his bid for re-election.  Miles Ward, your

    title: Such Blocking, Very Concurrency, Wow
    abstract: >
        Concurrency is fundamentally at the base of scaling. How do you manage
        to do more things at once? Well, you do them at the same time. This opens
        a huge can of worms though, because every different approach to how you do
        this has disadvantages, weaknesses, problems and tradeoffs. I will go
        through some approaches to concurrency that I've come across, speak of
        common building blocks and issues that these approaches all share. I'll
        be mentioning things like the c10k problem, threads, actors, evented
        programming, interacting with IO, futures/promises, coroutines and more.

        Far from being a world-renowned expert on the matter, I will attempt to dissect
        these patterns and styles because I want to understand why they "scale,"
        problems you can run across, and when (pun intended!) it can drive you crazy.
        Hopefully by the end you will find it somewhat easier to understand and grasp,
        and have a newly driven passion to dig in further.

    title: Scale at the Square Kilometer Array
    abstract: >
        <p>
        Astronomy is one of the most scale obsessed of all the sciences.
        From our earliest attempts to understand the size of our planet through
        solar observations, through to our current appreciation of the ultimate
        scale of the universe, it constantly redefines our notion of "big".
        </p>
        <p>
        This escalation in scale can also be seen in our observational
        instruments, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. We are
        entering an epoch of massive expansion in observational capacity, which
        over the next 10 years we will see an 8 order of magnitude increase in
        the data volume being generated. This talk will focus on these
        instruments, their challenges, and what they will mean to the science
        of astronomy.

      Tech Startups - Avoid Sleepless Nights with Microsoft BizSpark
      </p>
      <p>
      At Microsoft we're big on business and being proudly South African. For decades
      we've focused on becoming a strategic partner to the growth of this country by
      championing sustainable development through technology. In the early days our
      goal was to put a computer on every desk. Today we aim to change the lives of
      millions by developing products and solutions that people love and businesses
      need.
      </p>
      <p>
      We firmly believe that access to education and opportunity is the foundation
      upon which great nations are built. That's why we have invested in South Africa
      by continually supporting its rapidly emerging SME sector. Individuals who are
      brave enough to nurture their own creative ideas into platforms for job creation
      and economic growth should be celebrated. They are the engines that keep our
      country's economy ticking.
      </p>
      <p>
      With this in mind, we'd like to introduce Microsoft BizSpark.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is important to recognise the role technology startups play as significant
      contributors to the small enterprise mix. In just a few years businesses of this
      nature have revolutionised the way the world works by introducing services and
      platforms that simply did not exist before.
      </p>
      <p>
      To help drive this message forward Microsoft South Africa has initiated the
      BizSpark programme, a supportive forum that aims to drive the founding and
      growth of up to 600 technology start ups over the next three years.
      </p>
      <p>
      With assistance from the Jobs Fund we are partnering with South Africa's most
      inspiring technology SMEs to help facilitate their growth and development. It's
      a 360° view that centres on you, the startup. BizSpark provides technology,
      support and a community that is focused on how you work, how you view the world
      and how you are getting out there to change it.
      </p>
      <p>
      BizSpark offers a comprehensive array of the latest products that are aimed at facilitating growth. Participation gives members the equivalent of an MSDN subscription at no cost. This includes get access to over 900 products such as Windows Azure, Visual Studio, Windows Server and Windows 8. Everything you need to succeed, without the price tag.
      The tools are just one aspect of the BizSpark approach. Members are also afforded access to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform - eradicating the restrictive costs often associated with hosting servers and purchasing storage capacity as a small business.
      It's a package designed with technology start-ups in mind. Licensing and hosting fees can be difficult to honour when you're starting out. Microsoft would like to give you the tools needed to build a business without the sleepless nights.
      Application to the Microsoft BizSpark programme is open to anyone, provided your business complies with certain expectations:
      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be actively engaged in development of a software- based product or service at the core of your current(or intended) business.  </li>
        <li>The software must add significant and primary functionality to the integrated Microsoft software. You need to own the software you're developing, i.e. you cannot be licensing it.  </li>
        <li>Your business must be privately held and have been in business for less than five years.  </li>
        <li>You need to be bringing in less than R5 million in annual revenue. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      We know that it's tough out there, but we're with you every step of the way.
