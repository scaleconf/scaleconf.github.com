  simon_cross:
    name: Simon Cross
    company: Praekelt
    role: Lead Developer
    country: SA
    bio: >
        Simon enjoys exploring details and finding ways to make the world a better place.
        From a childhood filled with weekends on the rocky beaches of South Africa’s west
        coast and fortuitous early access to the GW-BASIC reference manual, he made his way
        through high school and into academia, where he spent a lot of time learning details
        like quantum mechanics and general relativity. Somehow he completed an MSc in Applied
        Mathematics, despite discovering the wonders of Linux and open-source software in
        the middle. Since leaving academia, Simon has written code for a variety of commercial
        and scientific projects ranging from online newspapers to petrochemical companies and
        from bioinformatics to radio astronomy. In his spare time Simon contributes to and
        maintains a number of open source software projects, writes the odd computer game
        or two, engages in old-fashioned pen-and-paper gaming and tries to get out to the
        swimming pool or squash court every now and then. Simon is currently the lead
        developer of Vumi, a scalable mobile messaging platform developed by the Praekelt
        Foundation and recently organized the first two PyConZA conferences.

        projects and on coaching/training PHP engineers.
    title: Caching and Tuning fun for high scalability
    abstract: >
        Caching has been a 'hot' topic for a few years. But caching takes more than merely taking
        data and putting it in a cache : the right caching techniques can improve performance and
        reduce load significantly. But we'll also look at some major pitfalls, showing that
        caching the wrong way can bring down your site. If you're looking for a clear explanation
        about various caching techniques and tools like Memcached, Nginx and Varnish, as well as
        ways to deploy them in an efficient way, this talk is for you.

    title: Offloading the Rendering of your View to your Clients
    abstract: >
        Performance improvements in modern browsers coupled with the acceptance of javascript
        as a first class language gives us a compelling platform to move a bulk of what used
        to be done earlier on the server side to the client. This allows the distribution of
        processing power and removing some obvious bottlenecks on the server side. This talk
        aims to share our experience with the advantages of using this approach along with its
        limitations. We talk about single page web applications, client side consumption of
        RESTful services, performance gotchas, single code base for designers and developers
        and its effect on building a portable client and scalable server code.

    role: Software Developer
    twitter: aslamkhn
    bio: >
        is an African software developer, by birth, by choice
        and for life.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code
        as an expression of design. The same goes for architecture too - it''s all design.
        The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very, very hard,
        because achieving a harmonious balance is difficult.  The same with scalability
        - it throws us into extreme states, way off balance.  That is the challenge
        - finding a new equilibrium.  You can read his blog at http://f3yourmind.net
    title: Puppet for Human Beings (not!)
    abstract: >
        We can make servers look alike with Puppet, Chef, Ansible and most
        probably other machinery that we are going to invent.  And it makes us
        happy, because we like conformity and consistency.  Life is easier like
        that, we believe or hope.  Yet, at ScaleConf 2013, I noticed that every
        company that told their story increases people proportional to
        increases in servers.  How did that work out?  Did we make all people
        the same - like our servers? Do we want that in the first instance?
        And if we don't want clones, what do we want? How do we scale a culture
        if value diversity?  Which emerges first - consistency in values, or
        consistency in technology? What is the tail that is wagging a body?  I
        will explore these and other challenges - the really tough stuff that
        continuous delivery pipelines don't solve.  I hope you will help me
        answer those questions?  I believe that when we understand this, we can
        achieve scale and balance. That's what I'm after - equilibrium at
        scale.

    title: Scaling push notifications to millions of devices
    abstract: >
        Sending  notifications to millions of devices is quite challenging. Using
        native push notification services comes with the burdens of different APIs per
        platform, the need to manage the individual device registrations, the
        complexity of message personalization, and the need to massively scale when
        sending millions of notifications simultaneously. Notification hubs take a
        different approach: they're based on pub/sub and designed to elastically
        scale. They provide message templates for personalization and a single API
        across iOS, Android and Windows.

        Scaling and Reliable Deployment of Hardware, Firmware and Software into the complex African micro-entrepreneurial market.
    abstract: >
        Nomanini's target market, mostly micro-entrepreneurs, rely on the
        Nomanini solution for their livelihood. Therefore Nomanini has to
        surmount the difficulties of building a scalable, repeatedly
        deliverable hardware, firmware and back-end software solution capable
        of processing millions of financial transactions in the technically
        difficult African environment.
        </p>
        <p>
        In his talk Dale discusses these challenges and reflects on solutions,
        lessons learned and future improvements.

  daniel_schauenberg:

    country: USA
    quote: Automation, documentation and simplicity are his usual tools
    twitter: mrtazz
    bio: >
        is a Software Engineer in Etsy's infrastructure and development tools
        team. Automation, documentation and simplicity are his usual tools for
        improving the status quo. He previously worked in systems and network
        administration, on connecting chemical plants to IT systems and as an embedded
        systems networking engineer. Things he thoroughly enjoys when not writing code
        include coffee, breakfast, TV shows and basketball.
    title: Scaling Deployment at Etsy
    abstract: >
        At Etsy we have over 100 engineers deploying more than 40 times a day. This
        culture of continuously deploying small change sets enables us to build and
        release robust features all while serving over a billion page views per month.
        In order to make sure we can keep up this pace, we have development and
        deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to
        make changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on
        your first day - even if you're a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how is it possible to deploy so frequently among so many engineers and yet
        maintain a stable system? To answer this I give a high-level overview of the
        basic application structure to introduce the specific architecture we have at
        Etsy and how our development environment is set up. For development, every
        engineer gets their own VM with the full application stack configured. This
        makes it easy to get started and puts every developer in the same, familiar
        setup. This is a crucial part in removing confusion and ambiguity about how to
        work on and deploy changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the actual deployment we use a one-button deploy system - Deployinator -
        which we developed and opensourced. We integrated our system tightly with our
        company-wide IRC server and a set of tools we built to foster confidence,
        fast feedback and easy communication and collaboration between engineers. A
        detailed overview will be given on how the system works, how we use it and
        what problems we had to solve while making sure everyone can deploy as easily
        and fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The central source of confidence in our development process is our CI system.
        We have developed an easy way for developers to run tests on the CI cluster
        while developing to test changes before going into the deploy pipeline.
        Additionally tests are run on deploy and initiated by engineers with a tool
        called 'try' across 200 build machines. Our cluster setup is explained along
        with what problems we hit with an ever-growing codebase and number of
        engineers, and how we made our current setup fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        Continuous Deployment and the ability to quickly make changes are crucial for
        moving fast and iterating on products. Our deployment system works very well
        and is keeping up with the demands of a growing site and team. After attending
        this talk you will understand exactly how we approach Continuous Deployment
        and Continuous Integration at Etsy and get insight into what went wrong along
        the way and how we fixed it.

    title: Let's build a solid base for a scale.
    abstract: >
        Creating fast, reliable and easy to develop systems is not the easiest task.
        If you add the fact that thousands of companies use your system as a core business
        platform on a daily basis, it becomes challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
        Add a flavour of a scalability and millions of users and it moves on to exciting.
        How can we prepare a system that might be affected by scalability issues
        everywhere, even in the simplest component?
        </p>
        <p>
        The answer is to dive deep into the world of services.
        We decided to prepare a strong base on top of which we can build our
        system. Our choice was to start with the Java stack.
        We've gathered all the cool stuff from open source projects to create a bootstrap
        to let our developers create scalable services really fast.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this talk I would like to focus on the choices we made, and the
        ecosystem we built over our services.  It is not only about the code we
        write, but also the tools that make our life easier.  We will look at
        frameworks to provide REST services, and see how to make them auto
        discoverable.  We will also discuss tools to let us monitor and manage
        all the instancesi we run.  If you want to create or upgrade your service
        to scale it is the best place to start.

        Little teams with big results: NASA/JPL and Obama for America via AWS
    abstract: >
        In 2012 two small teams set about delivering on massive expectations, on
        "failure-is-not-an-option" projects, with extraordinarily limited time and
        resources. Both teams nailed it: every space geek in the world saw the Mars
        Curiosity Rover's first images live from Amazon S3 and Cloudfront and
        watched an HD live-stream of the event, and the 170+ custom applications on
        AWS powering the radical Obama for America campaign played no small part in
        helping President Obama win his bid for re-election.  Miles Ward, your
        presenter, worked embedded within these teams during the design, development,
        testing, deployment and operational phases of these projects, and can relay
        a few critical insights about the use of cloud at this scale.  100,000 WCU
        DynamoDB tables; replicating 27TB across the continent; 60+ terabit/s of
        live-streamed video; over a billion dollars in processed donations;
        hundreds of instances, 528,000 IOPS, oh my!

        into doing this? And what are challenges to maintain this with an ever growing
        user base, in many new places around the world? In this talk, we'll describe
        how the audio playback pipeline at Spotify is built and optimized. It will
        cover a wide range of areas involved, from how the clients work to the storage
        solutions that backs it all.

        Robert will tour through Cognician's new architecture and ops
        infrastructure, which leverages the many advantages of Clojure - such as
        functional programming, immutable data and deep Java interop - and Datomic,
        a new database engine from the creator of Clojure, which solves many of the
        common data-handling concerns when scaling web applications, so that
        scaling is far more simple to reason about and accomplish.

        After helping scale and support some of the largest Ruby production
        systems around, he moved on to engineering in one of the leading
        Platform as a Services (PaaS) companies. Shai enjoys solving problems,
        facing new challenges and playing jazz standards when he's not finding
        out something new on his laptop.
    title: Such Blocking, Very Concurrency, Wow
    abstract: >
        Concurrency is fundamentally at the base of scaling. How do you manage
        to do more things at once? Well, you do them at the same time. This opens
        a huge can of worms though, because every different approach to how you do
        this has disadvantages, weaknesses, problems and tradeoffs. I will go
        through some approaches to concurrency that I've come across, speak of
        common building blocks and issues that these approaches all share. I'll
        be mentioning things like the c10k problem, threads, actors, evented
        programming, interacting with IO, futures/promises, coroutines and more.

        Far from being a world-renowned expert on the matter, I will attempt to dissect
        these patterns and styles because I want to understand why they "scale,"
        problems you can run across, and when (pun intended!) it can drive you crazy.
        Hopefully by the end you will find it somewhat easier to understand and grasp,
        and have a newly driven passion to dig in further.

        significant amount of his coding time trying to avoid writing C, and
        the rest of the time trying to use sys._getframe() in ways that annoy
        his colleagues.
    title: Scale at the Square Kilometer Array
    abstract: >
        <p>
        Astronomy is one of the most scale obsessed of all the sciences.
        From our earliest attempts to understand the size of our planet through
        solar observations, through to our current appreciation of the ultimate
        scale of the universe, it constantly redefines our notion of "big".
        </p>
        <p>
        This escalation in scale can also be seen in our observational
        instruments, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. We are
        entering an epoch of massive expansion in observational capacity, which
        over the next 10 years we will see an 8 order of magnitude increase in
        the data volume being generated. This talk will focus on these
        instruments, their challenges, and what they will mean to the science
        of astronomy.
