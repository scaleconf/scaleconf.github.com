    - heading: Approach
      text: The world’s changing media and technology landscape requires a new kind of organization that combines innovation with creativity, technology with strategy. Praekelt works in partnership with brands, mobile network operators, content creators, user experience specialists and digital technologists to create platforms, applications and campaigns that engage and inspire. With a multidisciplinary team across five international offices, we harness the power of mobile technology to change behaviour.
    - heading: Foundation
      text: Praekelt believes that mobile technology has the power to improve the lives of people living in poverty and that this technology should be widely available and free, or as close to free as possible, to access. Through our sister company Praekelt Foundation we build platforms that provide NGOs and social business with tools to make a difference, and through projects like Young Africa Live we’re demonstrating the ways mobile can change the world.
