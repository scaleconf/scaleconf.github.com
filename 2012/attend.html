                The fee for the conference is R1250.00 via EFT*, or $160 via
                other payment methods (we've been fortunate with sponsorship
                and attendance and so we didn't need to increase on the
                early-bird price too much!).
              </b>
                Part of every ticket will also be going to a charity (still to be
                decided - email us if you are really passionate about any charity
                in particular).
              </p>

              <p>The ticket includes entrance, lunch on both days, great speakers, and the opportunity to network with others in the industry.</p>
