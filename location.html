                  Set against the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens was established nearly 
                  100 years ago to conserve and promote the diverse indigenous flora of South Africa. Kirstenbosch covers 26 hectares, 
                  and falls within the Cape Floristic Region, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004. With over 7 000 plant species, 
                  interspersed with rolling green lawns, the Garden makes for beautiful and relaxed setting, just 15 minutes from Cape Town's CBD.

                  <h6 style='color:#555'>Transport in Cape Town</h6>
                  <p>
                  South Africa has a good long-distance bus system, but using airlines to travel between major cities is recommended due to 
                  the time and distance (and better quality of travel). If you do want to go the more scenic route, you can try one of the 
                  many bus companies: <a href='http://greyhound.co.za'>Greyhound</a>, <a href='http://translux.co.za'>Translux</a> and <a href='http://intercape.co.za'>Intercape</a>. 
                  If you'd prefer the backpacker style of getting around the country, you might want to check out <a href='http://bazbus.com'>Bazbus</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Once in Cape Town, you can get around using the relatively new <a href='http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/MyCiti/'>MyCiti</a> bus system, or you can use one of the many 
                  taxi companies. If you are going to use taxis, we recommend <a href='http://excitetaxis.co.za'>Excite Taxis</a>, or <a href='http://www.rikkis.co.za/'>Rikkis</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  You can rent a car from around R330 (USD 40) per day. There are a number of car rental companies to choose from, but we would suggest you contact Pangea for 
                  competitive rates with minimum excess and unlimited mileage.

                  <p>
                  A top tourist destination, there are many things to do and see. The Cape Town tourism department has 
                  a great website, <a href='http://capetown.travel'>capetown.travel</a> with some ideas to get you going 
                  in the right direction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If you're an outdoors person, Cape Town has a number of reserves where you can go walking, running, cycling,
                  climbing and more. There are some amazing hikes that take you up Table Mountain or Lion's Head where you
                  can take in the spectacular views of Cape Town.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If you want to spend some time relaxing, there are numerous beaches (although the water is a little chilly), and during
                  the summer months (October-March), the temperature stays between 20-35C (68-95F). If you're into surfing or bodyboarding, 
                  Cape Town has some sweet surf spots, as well as some huge swells where people from around the world come for some big wave surfing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  And if you'd like to explore the local culture and heritage, there's Robben Island (where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned), the 
                  Cape Town Castle, Slave Lodge, District Six Museum, the old Cape Malay Quarter in Bokaap, township tours, and a number of restaurants 
                  serving traditional cuisine. Just outside of Cape Town, you could travel the Wine Route, tasting wine among picturesque vineyards and 
                  farmsteads, some of which date to the 17th century. Or head up to the Cederberg mountain range, where'll you find numerous rock paintings 
                  by South Africa's “First Peoples”, the Khoe and San hunter-gatherers. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  If you'd like to do a bit of travelling further afield, either before or after the conference, Pangea highly recommends the following packages:
                  </p>
                  <h7 style='font-weight: bold'>Beach and Bush Holiday</h7>
                  <p>
                  Experience the beauty of South African beaches as you meander up to Plettenberg Bay for an unforgettable 4-night beach holiday. Couple this with 
                  the ultimate wildlife experience and see the "Big 5" for yourself in a malaria-free game reserve on South Africa's East Coast for a further 4 nights.
                  </p>
                  <h7 style='font-weight: bold'>Gourmet Cycle Tour through the Karoo</h7>
                  <p>
                  Cycle in, around and over the incredible Swartberg Pass and spend your nights dining on culinary delights surrounded by traditional South African Karoo luxury.
                  </p>
                  <h7 style='font-weight: bold'>West Coast Meander</h7>
                  <p>
                  Spend a week up the South African West Coast - an undiscovered treasure trove of unspoilt beaches, incredible mountains and wide open spaces. Unwind in the 
                  little village of Paternoster with its fresh fish delicacies while you pass the day ambling along the beach or relax in a hammock with a good book.

                  <p>
                    We&#8217;re still in the planning stages, but there will definitely be social events and a hackathon. We&#8217;re also looking at organising wine-tasting and 
                    a trip to see the penguins in the days following the conference.
                  </p>
                  <!--h6 style='color:#555'>Accommodation</h6>
                  <p>
