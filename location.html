                  <p>
                  A top tourist destination, there are many things to do and see. The Cape Town tourism department has 
                  a great website, <a href='http://capetown.travel'>capetown.travel</a> with some ideas to set you going 
                  in the right direction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If you're an outdoors person, Cape Town has a number of reserves where you can go walking, running, cycling,
                  climbing and more. There are some amazing hikes that take you up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_Mountain">Table Mountain</a> or Lion's Head where you
                  can take in the spectacular views of Cape Town.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If you want to spend some time relaxing, there are numerous beaches (although the water is a little chilly), and during
                  the summer months (October-March), the temperature stays between 20-35C (68-95F). There is also Kirstenbosch
                  Gardens, a stunning botanical garden backed against Table Mountain reserve, which is a great place to take in nature, have 
                  a picnic, go for a walk, or just relax in the shade.
                  <p>
                  </p>
                  If you're into surfing or bodyboarding, Cape Town has some sweet surf spots, as well as some huge swells
                  where people from around the world come for some big wave surfing.

                  <h6 style='color:#555'>Transport in Cape Town</h6>
                  <p>
                    South Africa has a good long-distance bus system, but using airlines to travel between major cities is recommended due to the time and distance (and better quality of travel). If you do want to go the more 
                    scenic route, you can try one of the many bus companies: <a href='http://greyhound.co.za'>Greyhound</a>, <a href='http://translux.co.za'>Translux</a> and <a href='http://intercape.co.za'>Intercape</a>. If you'd prefer the backpacker 
                    style of getting around the country, you might want to check out <a href='http://bazbus.com'>Bazbus</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once in Cape Town, you can get around using the relatively new <a href='http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/MyCiti/'>MyCiti</a> bus system, or you can use one of the many taxi companies. If you are going to
                    use taxis, we recommend <a href='http://excitetaxis.co.za'>Excite Taxis</a>, or <a href='http://www.rikkis.co.za/'>Rikkis</a>.

                  <h6 style='color:#555'>Organised events</h6>
                  <p>
                    We&#8217;re still in the planning stages, but there will definitely be social events and a hackathon.  We&#8217;re also looking at organising wine-tasting and a trip to see the penguins in the days following the conference.
