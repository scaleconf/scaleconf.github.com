              After the second day, the restaurant at the venue will be open until midnight, and offers a great opportunity for a sponsor to provide a good night of entertainment, network, and engage local talent.

              After the first day there are no events planned which will give Dinner Sponsors the opportunity to invite and take out a selection of candidates to a restaurant in Cape Town.
              Candidates will indicate any dinner they would like to attend during registration, and a company may also invite specific candidates based on their signup information.
