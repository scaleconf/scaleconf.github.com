              <h3>WiFi Sponsorship</h3>
              <p>
                 <strong>To be decided</strong>
                 <small></small>

              <p>
              The venue will require a wifi hotspot to be set up for attendees to use during the conference.  The
              WiFi Sponsor will receive a prominent mention during the conference, and branding up at the venue.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Party Sponsorship</h3>
              <p>
                 <strong>R20 000 - R30 000</strong>
                 <small>(1200-3700 USD depending on exchange rate)</small>
              </p>
              <p>
              After the second day, the restaurant at the venue will be open until midnight, and offers a great
              opportunity for a sponsor to provide a good night of entertainment, to network, and to engage local talent.

              <h3>Dinner Sponsorship</h3>
              <p>
                 <strong>Around R5000, depending on restaurant</strong>

              <p>
              After the first day there are no events planned which will give Dinner Sponsors the opportunity to
              dine with a selection of attendees at a restaurant in Cape Town.  This gives Dinner Sponsors a chance
              to network with attendees and possibly find partners or prospective hires.

              Speakers are the core focus of the conference where attendees will be sure to take notice and be
              inspired. With some branding on speaker slides, the company is sure to benefit the reputation of
              their backing company through association.
