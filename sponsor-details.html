              Candidates will indicate any dinner they would like to attend during registration, and a company may also invite specific candidates based on their signup information.

              <p>
              Speakers are the core focus of the conference where attendees will be sure to take notice and be inspired. With some branding on speaker slides, the company is sure to benefit the reputation of their backing company through association.
