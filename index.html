      Each year ScaleConf brought international and local experts
      together to share their experience scaling websites and services
      using modern technologies and philosophies.

          <p>
            Dear everyone who has supported us throughout the years,
          </p>
          <p>
            We've been thinking long and hard about the future of ScaleConf, and we have come to the sad conclusion that
            too much
            has changed: in the world, in the way conferences work, and in our own ability to commit time and energy,
            and
            as such,
            we regretfully announce that we will not be holding another ScaleConf.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has been an absolutely wonderful journey over the last decade, and we would like to thank all of you, and
            all of our fantastic speakers and sponsors, without whom it would never have happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            We look forward to seeing you elsewhere - in person, online, and at other similar events, both in person and
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks again, and fond regards,
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            Marije, Duncan, Mike and Jonathan.
