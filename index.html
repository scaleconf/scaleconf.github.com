            ScaleConf is a two-day tech conference which brings together local and international experts to share their ideas on tools and methodologies for dealing with the
            problems of being a highly available service.

          <dl>
              <dt>Configuration Management</dt> <dd>Tools for the storage and management of your systems configuration across all your environments and servers mean that reproducing a system is trivial, and the days of wikis and lists of configs to tweak are gone.</dd>
              <dt>Infrastructure as Code</dt>   <dd>Your systems and servers are defined in code, along with all installed applications, dependencies and configuration. You can take advantage of version control and agile principles in your systems administration as well as in developing your software.</dd>
              <dt>Monitoring and Metrics</dt>   <dd>Without intimate knowledge of the baseline performance of your systems, it is impossible to tell where a problem or bottleneck arises when things go wrong. Metrics can show you where you will gain most business value from optimization.</dd>
              <dt>Continous Deployment</dt>     <dd>The shangri-la of release management: your code is released as you commit to revision control. The methods and tools and best practices to achieve this safely will allow you to start releasing improvements dozens of times a day without breakage or downtime.</dd>
              <dt>Virtualization</dt>           <dd>New tools and best practices for managing virtual server clusters give you the ability to create and tear down correctly configured servers and running services in seconds, speeding up your development lifecycle exponentially.</dd>
              <dt>NoSQL</dt>                    <dd>Increasingly, certain types of application are requiring an alternative to traditional relational databases.  Key-value in-memory stores like Redis or Memcached and document stores like MongoDB and CouchDB offer new approaches to solving issues that data storage systems face at scale.</dd>
