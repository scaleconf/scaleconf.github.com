        <p>
        With such a strong technical focus for the conference, we have decided
        to run workshops before the conference to give attendees hands on experience
        with the latest tools that are being used today.
        </p>
        <p>
        There will be workshops for everybody, broken down into multiple tracks
        with just a morning and afternoon session. The workshops will have limited
        capacity, so be sure to book the session you are interested in early.
