            With such a strong technically focused conference, we have decided
            to once again run some free workshops alongside the conference.
            The workshops are informal hackathon-style workshops
            where the engineers from various companies will be on hand to
            walk you through getting started on their products.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exact workshops that will make up this years offerings are not yet confirmed so 
            check back again soon or follow us on Twitter to ensure you know when they are.
        </p>
