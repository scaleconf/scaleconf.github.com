bio: >
    Daniel is a Software Engineer at Etsy's infrastructure and development tools
    team. Automation, documentation and simplicity are his usual tools for
    improving the status quo. He previously worked in systems and network
    admninistration, on connecting chemical plants to IT systems and as an embedded
    systems networking engineer. Things he thoroughly enjoys when not writing code
    include coffee, breakfast, tv shows and basketball.
title: Scaling Deployment at Etsy
abstract: >
    At Etsy we have over 100 engineers deploying more than 40 times a day. This
    culture of continuously deploying small change sets enables us to build and
    release robust features all while serving over a billion page views per month.
    In order to make sure we can keep up this pace, we have development and
    deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to
    make changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on
    your first day - even if you're a dog.

    But how is it possible to deploy so frequently among so many engineers and yet
    maintain a stable system? To answer this I give a high-level overview over the
    basic application structure to introduce the specific architecture we have at
    Etsy and how our development environment is set up. For development every
    engineer gets their own VM with the full application stack configured. This
    makes it easy to get started and puts every developer in the same, familiar
    setup. This is a crucial part in removing confusion and ambiguity about how to
    work on and deploy changes.

    For the actual deployment we use a one button deploy system - Deployinator -
    which we developed and open sourced. We integrated our system tightly with our
    company wide IRC server and and a set of tools we built to foster confidence,
    fast feedback and easy communication and collaboration between engineers. A
    detailed overview will be given on how the system works, how we use it and
    what problems we had to solve while making sure everyone can deploy as easy
    and fast as possible.

    The central source of confidence in our development process is our CI system.
    We have developed an easy way for developers to run tests on the CI cluster
    while developing to test changes before going into the deploy pipeline.
    Additionally tests are run on deploy and initiated by engineers with a tool
    called 'try' across 200 build machines. Our cluster setup is explained along
    with what problems we hit with an ever growing codebase and number of
    engineers and how we made our current setup fast.

    Continuous Deployment and the ability to quickly make changes are crucial for
    moving fast and iterating on products. Our deployment system works very well
    and is keeping up with the demands of a growing site and team. After attending
    this talk you will understand exactly how we approach Continuous Deployment
    and Continuous Integration at Etsy and get insight into what went wrong along
    the way and how we fixed it.
