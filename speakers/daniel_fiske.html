bio: >
    Daniel has spent more than 15 years designing and building massively
    scalable systems for the gaming and gambling sectors. He began in 1997 as a
    software developer for one of the world’s first online casino groups, and
    in 2005 co-founded RightShift as a multiplayer FPS tournament business that
    later pivoted into social gaming in 2008 and (several apps later) launched
    Clickfun Casino in 2011.</p>
    <p>Bootstrapped entirely by the founders without any external funding, Daniel
    and his team have built out proprietary infrastructure capable of
    supporting millions of users. This experience together with his background
    in real money gaming gives Daniel a unique understanding of the overall
    gaming market and a perspective on the rapid convergence of social and real
    money gaming that few others are likely to have.
title: Tales from the Trenches
abstract: >
    The story of how RightShift scaled it’s business and architecture to
    successfully compete in the competitive social casino arena with their
    flagship Clickfun Casino product. Daniel shares first-hand insight into
    scaling a modern business and high volume platform and is as much an
    enlightening tale of getting things right as a cautionary tale of what not
    to do.
