              We are trying to make this event as accessible as possible in order to promote the best practices and technologies to help drive
              the same culture over here. For this to happen, we need some help. We are not offering packages to sponsors but
              would rather engage each sponsor personally to see what will be beneficial for both parties. If you or your company are in a position to help 
              with funding, equipment, speakers, or anything else, please <a href='/contact-us'>get in touch with us.</a>
